## My process

### Built with

-  HTML5
-  SASS
-  JavaScript
-  [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org)

### What I learned

-  Before starting this project, I went through the basics of **Vue.js** and used that basic knowledge to start working on the presentation.
-  I learned why frameworks like **Vue** are so important and why they are used so often.
-  The process of coding the project also gave me a chance to practice my **frontend skills** and to be better at:
   -  making **responsive websites**
   -  working with **source control**

### Continued development

-  Going forward, I want to **practice** what I already know by tackling more **JavaScript** and **Vue** focused projects. Ranging from **small** to **large** projects.

-  I also want to learn better coding practices and improve my overall skills in **Frontend Web Development**.

### Useful resources

-  [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) - Inkscape SVG Editor. I use it all the time when I'm working on any web project. After designing this project, I used _Inkscape's_ in-built tools to figure out the _spacing_, _sizing_ and _positioning_ of elements throughout the project.
